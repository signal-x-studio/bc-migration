## Low Relevance Images (Score < 5)

### Describe the Pear
- File: describe-the-pear.mdx
- Score: 4/10
- Description: The image shows a person observing jellyfish in a large tank, likely at an aquarium. The scene is lit with a deep blue light, highlighting the translucent forms of the jellyfish against the darker background. The person is silhouetted and their focus seems to be solely on the jellyfish.
- Reason: The image has a loose connection to the blog post. The blog talks about an LLM being an observer, and the image depicts someone observing jellyfish. One could draw a metaphorical link between the LLM and the person observing, and the 'things being observed' (data and jellyfish, respectively). However, without further context or visual cues pointing to the 'lack of taste' aspect, the link is weak. The visual doesn't offer specific connection to a pear or lack of taste/sensory experience.

### How I Used One AI to Train Another: A Tactical Reset in Data Architecture and AI Tooling Strategy
- File: the-ai-approach-reset.mdx
- Score: 4/10
- Description: The image shows a group of people sitting in a circle on the floor of what appears to be a CrossFit gym or training facility. They are looking at papers and possibly discussing something, surrounded by weights and other fitness equipment.
- Reason: The image's connection to the blog post about AI tools and data architecture is weak. The scene depicts a group analyzing documents, which could metaphorically relate to analyzing data or strategizing, but this is a stretch. The setting of a CrossFit gym adds further disconnect. It would have been better if the image had shown a connection to technology or computers.

### The Storefront That Builds Itself
- File: the-storefront-that-builds-itself.mdx
- Score: 4/10
- Description: The image features a person, likely a craftsman or engineer, focused on working with some sort of metallic apparatus. The person, wearing a cap and glasses, is slightly out of focus in the background while their hand holding a tool with a wooden handle is brought into focus. The scene is lit with an intense, direct light source overhead.
- Reason: The image shows someone working on machinery, which could loosely be interpreted as 'building' something. The focus on a complex process might subtly connect to the idea of an 'AI architecture.' However, the image is quite literal and doesn't directly convey the abstract concept of an e-commerce platform or AI, resulting in a low to moderate relevance score. It's more about physical construction than digital infrastructure.
