## Political Landscape (To Be Discovered)

### Questions to Answer

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Are the acquired products (Makeswift, Feedonomics) protective of autonomy? | |
| Is there existing tension between Core and acquired products? | |
| Who tried to unify these products before? What happened? | |
| Are there competing visions for AI-native? | |
| Who loses if integration succeeds? | |
| Are there separate P&Ls creating misaligned incentives? | |

### Potential Resistance Points

| Source | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|------|------------|
| Makeswift team | May see integration as loss of autonomy | Build relationship first, show benefit |
| Feedonomics team | May see integration as loss of autonomy | Build relationship first, show benefit |
| Existing architects/tech leads | May see you as threat | Collaborate, don't compete |
| Teams with sunk cost in current approach | May resist "Buy" recommendation | Frame as evolution, not repudiation |

## Relationship Building Tactics

### First Meeting Template

1. **Ask about their world first** - "What are you working on? What's hard right now?"
2. **Understand their priorities** - "What does success look like for you this quarter?"
3. **Find the overlap** - "Where might my work intersect with yours?"
4. **Offer value** - "How can I make your life easier?"
5. **Be honest about your agenda** - "Here's what I'm trying to accomplish..."

### Building Credibility

| Credibility Source | How to Build |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Delivery | Ship bc-migration on time |
| Technical | Show you understand their systems |
| Political | Don't blindside people |
| Strategic | Connect work to business outcomes |
| Personal | Be reliable, follow through |

### Warning Signs in Relationships

- Cancels meetings repeatedly
- Doesn't respond to messages
- Agrees in meetings but doesn't follow through
- Talks about you to others negatively
- Excludes you from relevant discussions
