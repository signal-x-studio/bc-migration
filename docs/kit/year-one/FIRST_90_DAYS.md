## Red Flags to Watch For

Things that should make you pause and reassess:

- [ ] CPO cancels multiple 1:1s in a row
- [ ] Engineering cohort gets pulled to other priorities
- [ ] WPEngine goes silent or changes requirements significantly
- [ ] Can't find a beta merchant by Week 6
- [ ] BC provisioning APIs are broken/undocumented
- [ ] Political resistance to integration work emerges
- [ ] Executive attention shifts away from AI-native

If you see these, escalate early. Don't wait.

---

## Month 3 Transition

By end of Month 3, you should be ready to shift focus:

**From:** Delivering bc-migration
**To:** Diagnosing integration debt + architecting AI-native foundation

The Q2 work (integration diagnostic, stakeholder interviews, semantic layer evaluation) should be queued up and ready to start post-Summit.
