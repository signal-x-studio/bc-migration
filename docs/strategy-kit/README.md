## Key Takeaways for Implementation

### The Thesis (from STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.html)
- WPEngine partnership provides distribution to 8,000 mid-market WooCommerce stores
- Migration must be dramatically easier than BigCommerce's current reputation
- WordPress stays intact - only the commerce engine changes

### The Investment (from Part V)
- Phase 0: $190K, 12 weeks, 4 team members, 3 pilot migrations
- GO/NO-GO Criteria: Partnership LOI, 80%+ automation, NPS >40, migration cost <$5K

### The Risks (from Part IV, AI Council)
- Score: 70.2/100 - "Directionally sound, assumptions need validation"
- Key gaps: Partnership terms unvalidated at time of writing (now validated per CFO)
- Technical complexity of WooCommerce plugin ecosystem

### The Recommendation (from Part VI)
- GO for Phase 0 validation
- Build assessment engine first (prove automation thesis)
- Partner enablement as force multiplier

## Context Evolution

These docs were created before the CFO conversation that confirmed:
- WPEngine partnership is REAL (not hypothetical)
- 3 customers + 3 agencies already lined up
- Catalyst is OUT - want simpler approach
- Ultra-small team: Nino + Jordan Sim + strategy person

Some assumptions in these docs are now outdated, but the strategic framing remains valid.
