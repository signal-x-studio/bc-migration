# Getting Started for Agencies

This guide helps agencies and migration partners manage multiple client migrations, white-label deployments, and offer migration services at scale.

## Agency Use Cases

### Migration Service Provider
Offer WooCommerce to BigCommerce migration as a service to your clients.

### WordPress/WP Engine Partner
Migrate WP Engine clients from WooCommerce to BigCommerce while maintaining WordPress for content.

### BigCommerce Partner
Help clients transition from WooCommerce to BigCommerce as part of your platform services.

## Multi-Client Management

### Client Isolation

Each client migration is isolated with separate:
- **Connection Configs**: Stored per client in browser localStorage
- **Migration State**: Independent progress tracking
- **Assessment Data**: Client-specific reports
- **Credentials**: Never shared between clients

### Managing Multiple Migrations

**Recommended Workflow**:

1. **Client Onboarding**:
   - Create a checklist for each client
   - Gather WooCommerce and BigCommerce credentials
   - Run initial assessment
   - Provide cost and timeline estimates

2. **Project Tracking**:
   - Use the dashboard for each client migration
   - Export assessment reports for client review
   - Track progress through the 4-phase wizard
   - Generate completion reports

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Test each migration in staging first
   - Verify data accuracy before go-live
   - Provide post-migration support period

### Browser-Based Multi-Client Setup

Since credentials are stored in localStorage:

```bash
# Option 1: Use browser profiles (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
- Create separate browser profile per client
- Install as PWA per profile
- Keeps credentials isolated

# Option 2: Use incognito/private windows
- Open private window for each client
- Configure credentials
- Complete migration
- Close window (clears localStorage)

# Option 3: Manual credential management
- Export/import credential JSON
- Store securely in password manager
- Load per client session
```

## White-Label Deployment

### Self-Hosted Deployment

Deploy your own branded instance:

```bash
# Clone and customize
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bc-migration.git
cd bc-migration

# Customize branding
# Edit src/dashboard/app/layout.tsx for agency branding
# Update logo in src/dashboard/public/
# Modify colors in src/dashboard/app/globals.css

# Build and deploy
cd src/dashboard
npm run build

# Deploy to your infrastructure
# Option 1: Vercel
vercel --prod

# Option 2: Docker
docker build -t agency-bc-migration .
docker run -p 3000:3000 agency-bc-migration

# Option 3: Traditional hosting
npm start
```

### Branding Customization

**Logo and Name**:

```typescript
// src/dashboard/app/layout.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Your Agency Name - BC Migration',
  description: 'Professional WooCommerce to BigCommerce Migration',
  // ... your branding
};
```

**Color Scheme**:

```css
/* src/dashboard/app/globals.css */
:root {
  --agency-primary: #your-primary-color;
  --agency-secondary: #your-secondary-color;
}
```

**Custom Domain**:
- Deploy to `migrate.youragency.com`
- Configure DNS CNAME or A record
- Set up SSL certificate

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# .env.production (agency deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENCY_NAME="Your Agency Name"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL="support@youragency.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_URL="https://youragency.com/support"
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL="https://docs.youragency.com"

# Optional: Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY="phc_xxxxx"

# Optional: Error tracking
SENTRY_DSN="https://xxxxx@sentry.io/xxxxx"
```

### Pricing Calculator

Factors for estimation:

```typescript
function estimateMigrationCost(assessment: AssessmentData): number {
  const basePrice = 1500;

  // Product complexity
  const productCost = assessment.products * 0.50; // $0.50 per product
  const variantCost = assessment.variants * 0.25; // $0.25 per variant

  // Customer data
  const customerCost = assessment.customers * 0.10;
  const orderCost = assessment.orders * 0.05;

  // Complexity multipliers
  let complexity = 1.0;
  if (assessment.customFields > 10) complexity += 0.3;
  if (assessment.categories > 100) complexity += 0.2;
  if (assessment.plugins > 20) complexity += 0.4;

  const subtotal = basePrice + productCost + variantCost + customerCost + orderCost;
  return subtotal * complexity;
}
```

## WordPress/WP Engine Integration

### Headless WordPress + BigCommerce

Many agencies keep WordPress for content while using BigCommerce for commerce:

**Architecture**:
- WordPress: Blog, marketing pages, content marketing
- BigCommerce: Product catalog, checkout, cart
- BC Bridge Plugin: Connects the two seamlessly

**Benefits**:
- Clients keep familiar WordPress CMS
- Superior commerce platform (BigCommerce)
- Best of both worlds

### BC Bridge Setup for Clients

1. **Install BC Bridge Plugin**:
   ```bash
   # On WordPress/WP Engine
   wp plugin install bc-bridge
   wp plugin activate bc-bridge
   ```

2. **Configure Connection**:
   ```php
   // wp-config.php
   define('BC_STORE_HASH', 'your-store-hash');
   define('BC_ACCESS_TOKEN', 'your-token');
   define('BC_CLIENT_ID', 'your-client-id');
   ```

3. **Customize Templates**:
   - Product detail pages
   - Category pages
   - Cart integration
   - Checkout flow

See [BC Bridge Installation Guide](/docs/guides/bc-bridge/installation) for details.

## Automation and Scaling

### Bulk Migration Script

For agencies running multiple migrations:

```typescript
// scripts/bulk-migrate.ts
import { MigrationOrchestrator } from '@/lib/migration/orchestrator';

interface ClientConfig {
  name: string;
  woocommerce: { url: string; key: string; secret: string };
  bigcommerce: { hash: string; token: string };
}

async function bulkMigrate(clients: ClientConfig[]) {
  for (const client of clients) {
    console.log(`Starting migration for ${client.name}...`);

    const orchestrator = new MigrationOrchestrator(
      client.woocommerce,
      client.bigcommerce
    );

    try {
      // Run all phases
      await orchestrator.runPhase('foundation');
      await orchestrator.runPhase('core-data');
      await orchestrator.runPhase('transactions');
      await orchestrator.runPhase('content');

      console.log(`✅ ${client.name} migration complete`);

      // Generate report
      await generateReport(client.name, orchestrator.getResults());
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`❌ ${client.name} migration failed:`, error);
      // Alert agency team
    }
  }
}
```

### Monitoring and Alerts

Set up monitoring for production migrations:

```typescript
// lib/monitoring/alerts.ts
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

export function trackMigrationProgress(clientName: string, phase: string, progress: number) {
  // Send to monitoring service
  Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
    category: 'migration',
    message: `${clientName} - ${phase}: ${progress}%`,
    level: 'info',
  });

  // Alert if stuck
  if (progress < 10 && Date.now() - startTime > 30 * 60 * 1000) {
    Sentry.captureMessage(`Migration stalled for ${clientName}`, 'warning');
  }
}
```
