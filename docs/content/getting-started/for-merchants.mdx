# Getting Started for Merchants

This guide will help you migrate your WooCommerce store to BigCommerce using the BC Migration tool.

## What You'll Need

Before starting your migration, make sure you have:

- **WooCommerce Store**: Admin access to your WooCommerce store
- **WooCommerce API Keys**: Consumer Key and Secret from WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → REST API
- **BigCommerce Store**: An active BigCommerce store (trial or paid)
- **BigCommerce API Credentials**: Store Hash and Access Token from BigCommerce → Settings → API → Store-level API accounts
- **Time**: Plan for 2-4 hours for a small store (under 1,000 products)

## Migration Overview

The migration happens in four phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation
Connect your stores and run an assessment to understand what will be migrated.

### Phase 2: Core Data
Migrate categories, products, and their attributes. This is typically the longest phase.

### Phase 3: Transactions
Migrate customer data, orders, and coupon codes.

### Phase 4: Content
Migrate blog posts, pages, and product reviews.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Connect Your WooCommerce Store

1. Navigate to the **Dashboard**
2. Click **Configure WooCommerce Connection**
3. Enter your store information:
   - **Store URL**: Your WooCommerce site (e.g., `https://mystore.com`)
   - **Consumer Key**: From WooCommerce REST API settings
   - **Consumer Secret**: From WooCommerce REST API settings
4. Click **Save Connection**

The system will test the connection automatically.

### 2. Connect Your BigCommerce Store

1. Click **Configure BigCommerce Connection**
2. Enter your store credentials:
   - **Store Hash**: Found in your BigCommerce API settings (format: `abc123xyz`)
   - **Access Token**: Generated from BigCommerce store-level API accounts
   - **Client ID**: From your API account (optional for migration, required for BC Bridge)
3. Click **Save Connection**

### 3. Run Assessment

Before migrating, run an assessment to see what can be transferred:

1. Click **Run Assessment**
2. Wait 2-5 minutes while the tool scans your WooCommerce store
3. Review the assessment report:
   - **Products**: How many products and variants
   - **Categories**: Category structure and depth
   - **Customers**: Customer accounts and order history
   - **Orders**: Total orders and statuses
   - **Issues**: Any potential problems detected

The assessment helps identify issues before migration starts.

### 4. Start Migration

Once you're ready:

1. Navigate to the **Migration Wizard**
2. The wizard will guide you through all four phases
3. Each phase shows:
   - **What will be migrated**
   - **Estimated time**
   - **Progress indicator**
4. Click **Start Phase** for each section

**Important**: You can pause and resume migration at any time. Progress is saved automatically.

### 5. Monitor Progress

Watch the real-time progress bars for:
- Categories being created
- Products being migrated
- Customers being transferred
- Orders being imported

If errors occur, they're logged and you can retry failed items.

### 6. Verify Migration

After each phase completes:

1. **Check BigCommerce**: Log in to your BigCommerce admin
2. **Verify Data**:
   - Products have correct prices and images
   - Categories are properly nested
   - Customer accounts are accessible
3. **Test Checkout**: Place a test order to ensure everything works
4. **Review Redirects**: Export URL redirects to avoid broken links

## What Gets Migrated

### ✅ Migrated Automatically

- **Products**: Titles, descriptions, SKUs, prices, images, variants
- **Categories**: Names, descriptions, hierarchies, images
- **Customers**: Names, emails, addresses (passwords reset required)
- **Orders**: Order history, statuses, line items, totals
- **Coupons**: Discount codes and rules (where compatible)
- **Reviews**: Product reviews and ratings
- **Pages**: WordPress pages as BigCommerce web pages
- **Blog**: WordPress posts to BigCommerce blog

### ⚠️ Requires Manual Setup

- **Theme/Design**: BigCommerce uses different themes (consider Catalyst or Stencil)
- **Custom Fields**: WooCommerce custom fields need manual mapping
- **Plugins**: WooCommerce plugins don't transfer (find BigCommerce alternatives)
- **Payment Gateways**: Reconfigure in BigCommerce settings
- **Shipping**: Set up shipping zones and rates in BigCommerce

### ❌ Not Migrated

- **User passwords**: Customers need to reset passwords
- **Plugin data**: Third-party plugin data structures
- **Draft products**: Only published products migrate
- **Internal notes**: Private order notes don't transfer

## After Migration

### 1. Post-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Test all product pages for correct pricing and images
- [ ] Verify category navigation works
- [ ] Check customer accounts can log in (after password reset)
- [ ] Test checkout process end-to-end
- [ ] Configure shipping zones and rates
- [ ] Set up payment gateways
- [ ] Configure tax settings
- [ ] Set up email notifications
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

### 2. URL Redirects

Export and implement redirects to maintain SEO:

1. Download the redirect CSV from **Assessment → Export Redirects**
2. Implement in:
   - **BigCommerce**: Settings → Redirects (manually)
   - **CDN**: Cloudflare/Fastly rules (bulk)
   - **Server**: nginx/Apache rules (via .htaccess)

### 3. Go Live

When ready to switch:

1. **Backup**: Create full backup of WooCommerce store
2. **Final Migration**: Run migration one last time to capture recent orders
3. **DNS**: Update DNS to point to BigCommerce
4. **Monitor**: Watch for errors in first 24-48 hours
5. **Support**: Have support resources ready for customer questions

## Common Issues

### "Connection Failed"
- **WooCommerce**: Check API keys have read/write permissions
- **BigCommerce**: Verify Access Token hasn't expired
- **Network**: Ensure firewall allows API connections

### "Product Import Failed"
- **SKU Conflicts**: BigCommerce requires unique SKUs
- **Invalid Prices**: Check for non-numeric price values
- **Missing Images**: Verify image URLs are accessible

### "Customer Import Skipped"
- **Duplicate Emails**: BigCommerce requires unique customer emails
- **Invalid Data**: Check for malformed email addresses
