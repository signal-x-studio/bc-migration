Introduction




 Choosing the right eCommerce
 platform is critical for aligning
 with your business needs and
 growth plans.
 This report compares WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento (Open Source),
 and BigCommerce across 11 key criteria, evaluating both B2C (retail) and B2B
 (wholesale) use cases. We consider three store sizes to assess how each platform
 scales. Each platform's strengths and weaknesses are highlighted, followed by a
 recommendation matrix to guide platform selection.

    Methodology
Methodology
Our comparative analysis employed a standardized approach to
ensure fair and accurate assessment of each platform's capabilities:



Implementation Approach
1. Standard Templates                                                  3. Data Volumes
   To maintain consistency across all platforms, we                       We implemented stores at three speciﬁc scale points:
   used standard templates for all implementations.                       On Woocommerce & Magento
   This ensured that design variables wouldn't                            Small: 800 simple products + 16 conﬁgurable products
   unfairly advantage any particular platform.                            Medium: 24,000 simple products + 640 conﬁgurable products
                                                                          Large: ~300,000 simple products + 8,000 conﬁgurable products


2. Product Data Sets                                                      On Shopify and BigCommerce
                                                                          Small: 100 simple products + 16 conﬁgurable products
   The team created custom product data import                            Medium: 24,000 simple products + 640 conﬁgurable products
   scripts speciﬁcally for this evaluation, rather than                   Large: ~100,000 simple products + 8,000 conﬁgurable products




                                                                                                                                         GLOBAL DIGITAL AGENCY
   using existing data. This allowed us to precisely
   control the data characteristics across all
   implementations.                                                    4. Platform-Speciﬁc Optimizations
                                                                          Each platform was conﬁgured according to best practices,
                                                                          including consulting with platform specialists
                                                                                                                                           15

Store Sizes and Use Case Scenarios



Small Stores (B2C & B2B)
Characteristics: Limited catalog and traffic
Priorities: Ease of setup, low cost, and basic features
(possibly requiring wholesale functions for B2B)

                                                                             B2C vs B2B Differences
Medium Stores (B2C & B2B)                                                    B2C stores emphasize customer
Characteristics: Growing catalogs and traffic                                experience, marketing, and conversion tools
Priorities: More robust integrations (e.g., marketing tools, ERP/CRM         (e.g., personalization, SEO, fast checkout)
for B2B), performance optimization, and moderate customization               B2B stores need account-based pricing,
                                                                             bulk ordering, quote management, and tight

Priorities: Enterprise-level requirements for scalability, advanced          GDPR compliance is a factor for all (especially
customization, multi-store/multi-region management, and                      in the EU), but industry-speciﬁc regulations
full-spectrum features (e.g., complex pricing, personalization, analytics)   are not in scope here.

forget the platform.

Performance at Scale:
Where Theory Meets Practice
An automotive equipment retailer's case study perfectly illustrates
WooCommerce's scaling challenges. With over 5,000 products and
complex automotive options (make/model/year matrices), they
achieved excellent frontend performance but suffered from backend
slowness. Their solution—integrating with Sage50 for automated price
and stock updates—shows how

creative workarounds often become
necessary as catalogs grow.
An agricultural cooperative experienced similar challenges, noting that

WooCommerce "slows as the quantity of products increases" despite
starting as a "cheaper alternative to Magento with more ﬂexibility than
Shopify." This reinforces our technical ﬁndings about WooCommerce's
performance limitations with large catalogs.

                                                                          106

The SEO Factor:
An Underestimated
Decision Driver

Multiple implementations chose WooCommerce speciﬁcally for
SEO advantages. The automotive equipment retailer selected it
"to preserve SEO in a hotly contested keyword" space, while
others cited "SEO considerations" as primary selection criteria.
This real-world validation conﬁrms that WooCommerce's
WordPress foundation provides tangible SEO beneﬁts that
matter in competitive markets.

The User Experience Divide:
Merchants vs. Customers


A fascinating pattern emerged regarding user experience
priorities. Magento implementations consistently noted a
"steep learning curve for both developers and content
managers," while BigCommerce received praise for
"Great UX and look and feel" from a fresh produce retailer.

This dichotomy reveals an important truth: platform selection
must balance merchant usability with customer experience.
Magento excels at customer-facing ﬂexibility but challenges

sometimes at the cost of deep customization.

B2B Complexity:
Beyond Feature Checklists

A medical supplies retailer's experience implementing a hybrid
B2B/B2C store on Shopify exposed "technical limitations and bugs"
despite Shopify's B2B features. This echoes a broader pattern:

B2B functionality often requires more
than feature availability—it needs mature,
battle-tested implementations.
An educational institution successfully implemented a B2B/B2C
hybrid on WooCommerce, praising its scalability and

Enterprise Scale Realities



A pet pharmacy processing over 1,000 orders daily on Magento validated
the platform's enterprise credentials but noted the signiﬁcant setup
expense and ongoing developer resource requirements. They had
migrated from Kentico, which they described as "unbelievable that they
were using this for eCommerce"—a reminder that platform misalignment
can severely constrain business growth.
