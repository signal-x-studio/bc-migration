<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<h3>Headless Commerce</h3>
<p>BC Migration enables a headless commerce architecture where BigCommerce serves as the commerce backend (products, cart, checkout) while WordPress continues to serve as the frontend (content, pages, theme). This separation provides scalability and flexibility.</p>
<h3>Zero-Downtime Migration</h3>
<p>The migration process is designed to minimize downtime. You can migrate data incrementally and test thoroughly before switching traffic to BigCommerce.</p>
<h3>Data Preservation</h3>
<p>All critical data is preserved during migration: products, variants, categories, customers, and historical orders. SEO metadata, URLs, and content remain in WordPress.</p>
