## Purpose of This Document

The Solution Review Package you received is not just a technical validation document. It is a **deliberate organizational assessment instrument** designed to surface who on your existing team can operate in the new model we discussed—and who cannot.

This companion document explains the methodology so you can observe and interpret the results.

## The Problem We Discussed

From our conversation:

> "I just don't find our engineering teams to be agile in their use of AI, hardly at all today. Things take too long and they have too many people involved."

> "If I hear the phrase tech debt one more time, I throw something."

> "I'm not getting that thought validation from anybody on my internal team."

You don't have a technology problem. You have a **velocity and mindset problem** embedded in your current operating model. The WooCommerce migration initiative will either:

1. **Succeed** - by operating outside the existing org with a small, fast team
2. **Fail** - by being absorbed into existing processes that will slow it to a crawl

But even if it succeeds in isolation, you still have the broader organization to contend with. The question is: **who from the current team belongs in the future state?**

## The Keeper Test

Netflix famously asks managers: *"If this person told me they were leaving for a similar job at another company, would I fight to keep them?"*

If the answer is no, they give a generous severance package now rather than carry someone who doesn't belong.

The inverse is equally important: *"If I was building this team from scratch today, would I hire this person?"*

Most organizations never apply this test because:
- It feels harsh
- There's no objective trigger to force the conversation
- Leaders avoid conflict
- "They've been here a long time" becomes a substitute for "they add value"

**The Solution Review Package creates the objective trigger.**

## How the Instrument Works

The document was designed with specific properties:

### 1. It Requires Substantive Engagement

The document contains:
- 20+ assumptions that need validation or correction
- Platform-specific questions for each team (BC, WPEngine, Feedonomics, Makeswift)
- 5 explicit decision points requiring input
- Technical risks with proposed mitigations that can be challenged

**A competent leader with relevant expertise should be able to engage with this in 1-2 hours and provide substantive feedback.**

There is no "I need more time to review" that is legitimate beyond 48-72 hours. The document is comprehensive but not complex. Anyone who claims they need weeks to respond is telling you something about their operating speed.

### 2. It Exposes Territorial Behavior

The document explicitly crosses organizational boundaries:
- Product architecture decisions
- Engineering implementation
- Platform capabilities
- Partnership dynamics
- Commercialization strategy

Leaders who respond with "that's not your area" or "you should have consulted with us first" are revealing that they protect turf over solving problems.

Leaders who respond with "here's what you're missing from my domain, let me help" are revealing they prioritize outcomes over ownership.

### 3. It Tests for Builder vs. Bureaucrat Mentality

The document was produced in <48 hours by one person using AI-augmented workflows. This is not hidden—it's obvious from the breadth and structure.

**Possible responses:**

| Response | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| "This is impressive, how did you do this so fast?" | Curious, wants to learn, growth mindset |
| "We should have our team review the methodology" | Process-oriented, will slow things down |
| "This doesn't follow our documentation standards" | Values compliance over substance |
| "I disagree with X, here's why, and here's an alternative" | Substantive contributor, keeper |
| "Let me schedule a meeting to discuss" | Defaults to meetings over action |
| "This is good but we need to align with the roadmap" | Will subordinate new initiatives to existing commitments |
| No response | Either overwhelmed, disengaged, or passive-aggressive |

### 4. It Creates a Concrete Artifact for Comparison

When you ask your current team to produce something similar, you now have a baseline:
- How long does it take them?
- How many people do they need?
- What's the quality of thinking?
- Do they add value or just reorganize information?

If a team of 5 takes 3 weeks to produce something of lesser quality than one person produced in 2 days, that tells you everything about the delta between current state and future state.

## Response Framework

Over the next 1-2 weeks, you will receive responses (or non-responses) to the Solution Review Package. Here is how to interpret them:

### Keeper Signals (Green)

- Responds within 48-72 hours with substantive feedback
- Corrects specific assumptions with evidence
- Identifies risks or gaps that were missed
- Proposes alternatives or improvements
- Asks clarifying questions that advance the work
- Offers to contribute or build on the foundation
- Engages directly rather than delegating to subordinates

### Caution Signals (Yellow)

- Responds but only with high-level comments, no substance
- Defers to others ("let me check with my team")
- Requests meetings instead of providing written feedback
- Focuses on format/process rather than content
- Acknowledges receipt but doesn't engage within a week
- Provides feedback only on their narrow domain, ignores the rest

### Severance Signals (Red)

- No response after 1 week without explanation
- Defensive or territorial response
- Dismissive of the approach ("we tried something like this before")
- Challenges the legitimacy of the exercise ("who asked for this?")
- Escalates concerns about being "blindsided" or "not consulted"
- Focuses on why it can't work rather than how it could
- Requires extensive hand-holding to understand the document
- Produces a counter-document that takes 10x longer and adds no value

## Who to Watch

Based on our conversation, the following people will receive or be exposed to the Solution Review Package:

| Person | Role | What to Watch For |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Jordan Sim | VP Product (SMB/Mid-market) | Does he engage substantively on platform decisions? Does he add value or just validate? |
| Strategy Lead (SMB) | Commercialization | Can they think through partnership and GTM implications quickly? |
| BC Platform Team | Technical validation | Do they confirm/correct assumptions on API capabilities, or punt? |
| Feedonomics Lead | ETL capabilities | Do they have clarity on what's possible, or need weeks to "investigate"? |
| Makeswift Lead | Integration path | Can they articulate the non-Catalyst story, or is it undefined? |
| Engineering Leadership | (Indirect exposure) | Do they view this as a threat or an opportunity? |

## The Broader Signal

This exercise also signals to the organization what the new operating model looks like:

1. **Speed over perfection** - A good document in 2 days beats a perfect document in 2 months
2. **Substance over process** - Written artifacts over meetings, decisions over alignment
3. **AI-augmented workflows** - One person + AI can outproduce traditional teams
4. **Accountability through artifacts** - Your response (or non-response) is visible and interpretable
5. **Cross-functional by default** - No one owns a problem, everyone owns the outcome

Leaders who thrive in this model will self-select in. Leaders who can't will self-select out—or be visibly unable to keep pace.

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Distribute the Solution Review Package** to the identified stakeholders with a clear deadline (e.g., "Please provide feedback by [DATE], we'll discuss in our sync on [DATE+2]")
2. **Do not pre-explain or soften** - Let the document speak for itself
3. **Observe response patterns** - Who responds quickly? Who needs reminders? Who engages substantively?

### Short-Term (Weeks 2-3)

4. **Conduct the review session** - Note who adds value in the room vs. who defers or obstructs
5. **Compare outputs** - If you've asked internal teams to produce similar analysis, compare velocity and quality
6. **Have direct conversations** - With leaders who showed caution or severance signals, probe deeper

### Medium-Term (Month 1-2)

7. **Make decisions** - The WP Engine initiative needs a small, fast team. Select based on demonstrated behavior, not tenure or title
8. **Generous severance for non-fits** - Better now than after they've slowed the initiative
9. **Promote keepers** - People who engaged substantively should be recognized and given more scope

## A Note on Compassion

This approach is not about being ruthless. It's about being honest.

Keeping someone in a role they can't succeed in—because the operating model has changed around them—is not kind. It's avoidant.

Generous severance, honest feedback, and a clean transition is more respectful than slow marginalization, performance improvement plans, and eventual termination.

The goal is to build a team that can win. That requires clarity about who belongs on it.

---

## Closing Thought

You said it yourself:

> "We don't have one person that we trust like that."

Now you will.

And more importantly, you'll have **evidence-based clarity** on which of your existing leaders can operate alongside that person—and which cannot.

The Solution Review Package is the first move. How people respond is the data. This companion document is the decoder ring.

Use it wisely.
